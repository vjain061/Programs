1. Diff between Bean and POJO.
Ans :- (1) A JavaBean follows certain conventions. Getter/Setter naming, having a public default constructor, being serialisable.
       (2) A POJO(plain-old-java-object) is not rigorously defined. It is a java object that does not have a requirement to implement a 
            particular interface or derive from a particular base class, or make use of particular annotations in order to  be compatible 
            with a given framework, and can be any arbitary/simple java object.
