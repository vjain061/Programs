spring.boot.starter.web dependency comes with so many build in jar's below is some list :-
Tomcat
Junit
JSON Marshaller
SLF4J
Spring libraries (Core, Aop, Bean, context and others)
Snake YAML

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan

@Configuration is alternative of @Bean

META-INF/spring.factories
1. Enable
2. Disable

Based on @Conditional/@Profiler

How this @Conditional works is that in anyclass if you want to create bean on some condition like create only when the dependent class bean is present only.
Some example of conditions :- (OnBeanCondition, OnClassCondition, OnJavaCondition, OnWebApplicationCondition)

This part comes under auto configuration feature.

SpringApplication.run(...) :- From the run method, the main application context is kicked off which in turn searches for the classes annotated with 
@Configuration, initializes all the declared beans in those configuration classes, and stores those beans in JVM, specially in space inside JVM which 
is known as IOC container. After creation of all the beans, automatically configures the dispatcher servlet and registers the default handler mappings,
messageconverts and all other basic things.

@EnableAutoConfiguration :- 1. Allow for configuration classes to be scanned dynamically.
                            2. Driven off spring.factories
                            3. @AutoConfigurationBefore and @AutoConfigurationAfter
                            
*Property Based Configuration*
1. application.properties or application.yaml
2. Enviroment Variable
3. Command-line parameter
4. Cloud Configuration 

*Bean Configuration*
Adding bean to default application class
Adding bean to separate configuration class
Importing XML-based configuration
Component Scanning

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Spring Profiles*
Can do it using two ways application.yaml or application.properties
spring.profiles

How to Engage profile
spring.profiles.active
Inject via command line or envirnment variable

Below is the example how we can set profile and use it.
application.yaml
spring:
  profiles: dev
server:
  port: 8000
---
spring:
  profiles: test
server:
  port: 8009
  
And then set envirnment variable  spring.profiles.active = dev/test to see the diff while running the application.

2. Follow below steps to work with spring profile using env specific application.properties files
  2.1 Create two files application-dev.properties and application-test.properties file and add (server.port=8084) and (server.port=8085) diff port in both file.
  2.2 Set Env veriable like spring.profiles.active=dev/test
