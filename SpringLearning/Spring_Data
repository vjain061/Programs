There are 3 repository interfaces in Spring Data JPA:

1. CrudRepository
2. PagingAndSortingRepository
3. JpaRepository

By default, Spring Boot expects that all repositories are located in a sub-packages of the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. 
If your application doesnâ€™t follow this default, you need to configure the packages of your repositories using an @EnableJpaRepositories annotation.

I Implements the Repository pattern.
