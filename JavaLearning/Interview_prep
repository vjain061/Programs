1. What scenario did you faced which was abnormal
a. Faced "Bag chunk header".
b. new fresher joined the team and helped him with no idea on anaconda for python.


1st Round (2 hours) 1. 16 Aptitude tests which contains  puzzles, math questions etc. Most of the questions from Quantitative Aptitude 
by R.S.Agarwal 2. 14 Java Objective Questions. Very very easy as they are basic questions. 3. Find the maximum element in a null 
terminated Linked list using recursions. Recursion is important. If the solution is not recursive, they would reject the solution.
4. 1 Math Question. A B C + A B C + A B C C C C 1 Medium difficulty Puzzle 2nd Round (2 hours) 1. Why did you leave Company 1 and join
Company 2 and so on till why do you want to leave the current Company? 2. Details on Tech used for the project and the explanation/usage
of the architecture. 3. Do you J2EE, Jsp, HashMap etc 4. Design Data Connection Pooling in Java. We are expected to implement a library
which will used by clients. They give a maximum of 45 minutes to solve this question 5. 1 puzzle. 3rd Round(1 hour) 1. Discussion on 
projects and counter questioning on how could it be done in a better way. The interviewer was more interested in how I took part in 
analyzing the problem. 2. 2 Simple puzzles and 1 Medium difficulty puzzle. 3. I have to move the Statue of Liberty from point A to B.
How would you do it? This is basically to test your handle over the SDLC steps along with Problem Solving. I mentioned that it was a 
logistic issue which has been solved by most people and I would be following the similar things to track my package's state and location.

        it invokes.

----------------------------------------------Wissen----------------------------------------------

1. Create this class as immutable.
final class person {
    private String name;
    private List<String> decrese;

    public person(String name, List<String> decrese) {
        this.name = name;
        this.decrese = decrese;
    }
    //get
    //and in getter of decrese we will return coppied/duplicate object not actual object.
}

2. Is this thread safe?
Class A {
    public void synchronized m1() {
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    }
    public static void main(String a[]) {
        A o1 = new A();
        A o2 = new A();

        01.m1();
        02.m1();
    }
}
Answer :- Yes synchronized method is always thread safe.

3. What is the execuation flow?
class Parent {
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("walk method of patent");//1
    }
    public void run() {
        walk();
        System.out.println("run method of patent");//3
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent {
    public void walk() {
        super.walk();
        System.out.println("walk method of child");//2
    }
    public void run() {
        super.run();
        System.out.println("run method of child");//4
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.run();
    }
}



List<Integer> ints;

4. sum of squra of all odd numberss

ints.stream().filter(it -> it % 2 == 0).map(it -> it*it).sum()

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

2 4 6 8 10

4 16 .... 100

HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = {1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4, 5,5, 6,6, 7,7}


map.get(k-1)


7 5 1 6 4 3 2

2. There are hierarchy of class like super class and sub class. You have to make sure only one object 
can be create for any class using new keyword. How you will impelement the class?

3. The below code will iterate sequentially through 1 to 6. Can we iterate the same list alternatively so
that it will print 1,3,5 with changing the while loop?

List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6);
Iterator it = list.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(it.next());
}

4. Read about multithreading deeply.....

5. Question :- Get Emp data in single shot.

public interface Emp{

void addEmp(int empId,String dept);

void udpateEmp(int EmpId, String dept);

List<EmpId> getEmpByDept(String dept);

}

class EmpImpl implements Emp {

    Map<String, List<Integer>> employeeDB = new HashMap();

    Map<Integer, String> employeeDB = new HashMap();

    void addEmp(int empId,String dept) {
        List<Integer> ids = employeeDB.get(dept);
        ids.add(empId);
        employeeDB.put(dept, ids);
    }

    void udpateEmp(int EmpId, String dept) {
        employeeDB.put(EmpId, dept);
    }

    List<EmpId> getEmpByDept(String dept) {
        Set<String> keys = employeeDB.keySet();
            
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
