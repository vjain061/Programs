1. Given 2 ascending sorted arrays, merge the arrays into a single array. 
Follow Up : 
  1.1  Modify the code to sort the array in descending order. 
  1.2  Time complexity and space complexity 

2. Given an array and sum k, find all the pairs where sum is equal to k. 
Follow Up:  
  2.1  Provide brute force and optimized approach both 
  2.2  Based on the approach asked about the time and space complexity. 

3. Indepth HashMap internals
