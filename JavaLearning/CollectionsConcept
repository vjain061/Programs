1. ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList are two weakly consistent/fail safe collection classes.
	In case of fail fast collections whenever we call next() method first it will check the value of of 
	"modCount" which indicate that the collection is changed or not, If the the value of modCount is not 
	as same as before then it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.

2. Queue In Collection :-
    2.1 -> Diff between poll() and remove() method in Queue interface is poll() method return null if queue is empty.
		but remove() method throw java.util.NoSuchElementException exception.
		
3. UnSupportedException comes when you try to add the value in UnModifiedCollection. Basically it means JVM is preventing 
	you to perform some operation.
	
4. Default size of Queue is 11.

5. Default size of HashMap bucket is 16.

6. Default size of ArrayList is 10.

7. ConcurrentHashMap provides better performance by locking only the portion of the map rather than blocking the whole
	map resulting in greater shared access, it does not allow null key or null value.
	
	It allows concurrent access to the map. Part of the map called Segment (internal data structure) is only getting locked while adding 
	or updating the map. So ConcurrentHashMap allows concurrent threads to read the value without locking at all. This data structure was
	introduced to improve performance.
	
	In implementation of ConcurrentHashMap we write modification logic in synchronized block and read logic in normal block so
	that multiple thread can read at the same time.
	
	a. ReentrantLock lock for locking macanism.
	b. default capacity = 16
	c. loadfactor = 0.75
	d. cuncurrency level = 16
	e. it is better choice more reads then write.

	Unlike Hashtable and Synchronized Map, it never locks whole Map, instead, it divides the map into segments and locking is done 
	on those.

8. Diff between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap
	a. ConcurrentHashMap is good option for multithreaded environment, using HashMap we can get synchronizedMap but this is
		same as lagacy HashTable.
	b. So basically if you use ConcurrentHashMap then it provide some additional facility like at a time more than one
		Thread can read the data.
	c. HashMap's performance is high and sometimes ConcurrentHashMap's performance is low because thread required to wait.
	d. In HashMap while iterating over it if we try to modify the object then it will throw ConcurrentModificationException which means it's fail 
	   fast in nature but in case of ConcurrentHashMap we can modify the object while iterating over it.
	e. In HashMap we can have key and value as null but in case of ConcurrentHashMap we can't hava key and value as null otherwise we will get 
	   NullPointerException.

9. ConcurrentHashMap vs SynchronizedMap
	a. Only part of map object is locked in case of ConcurrentHashMap but SynchronizedMap locks whole map object.
	b. The code of all method of SynchronizedMap is written in synchronized block.
	
9. Important points about TreeSet :-
	a. In order to add custom or user defined objects to TreeSet data structure, the custom class should implement the Comparable 
	   interface or a Comparator should be passed to TreeSet constructor during creation. This is required because TreeSet does not allow 
	   duplicate elements and to ensure this with custom objects, TreeSet requires a comparator function to perform the comparison 
	   of custom objects. If a comparator is not specified then when you try to add a custom object to TreeSet, it will 
	   throw java.lang.ClassCastException.
	   
10. Homegeneous and Hetrogeneous -> Array have a runtime check on the type of the added element. That is, if a new element that is not of the same type  
	is added, an ArrayStoreException is thrown at runtime. That's why they are considerd as "homegeneous".
	That is not true for ArrayList. Due to type erasure at runtime, it can practically hold any object.
	
11. HashMap java 8 Implementation -> 
	a. But you can't rely on people to implement good hash functions. People will often write poor hash functions which will result in a 
		non-even distribution. It's also possible that we could just get unlucky with our inputs means (It might possible that
		we will get same hashcode and same bucket index for more elements).
	b. The implementation of Hashmap tries to mitigate this by organising some buckets into trees rather than linked lists if the 
		buckets becomes too large. This is what TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8 is for. If a bucket contains more than eight items, 
		it should become a tree.
	c. This tree is a Red-Black tree. It is first sorted by hash code. If the hash codes are the same, it uses the compareTo 
		method of Comparable if the objects implement that interface, else the identity hash code.
	d.If entries are removed from the map, the number of entries in the bucket might reduce such that this tree structure is no 
		longer necessary. That's what the UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 6 is for. If the number of elements in a bucket drops below six,
		we might as well go back to using a linked list.
		
12. TreeSet work as homogeneous, we can not add different value like string and int at same time.
	If we try to add this we will get "ClassCastException" at run time.
	
13. Look at the below example to understand why stringbuffer and stringbuilder is not overriding equals and hashcode methods.

        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("abc");
        StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("abc");
        
        StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer("abc");
        
        Map<StringBuffer, String> hm = new HashMap<>();
        hm.put(sb, "vaibhav");
        hm.put(sb1, "jain");
        System.out.println(hm.get(sb2));
