1. ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList are two weakly consistent/fail safe collection classes.
	In case of fail fast collections whenever we call next() method first it will check the value of of 
	"modCount" which indicate that the collection is changed or not, If the the value of modCount is not 
	as same as before then it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.

2. Queue In Collection :-
    2.1 -> Diff between poll() and remove() method in Queue interface is poll() method return null if queue is empty.
		but remove() method throw java.util.NoSuchElementException exception.
		
3. UnSupportedException comes when you try to add the value in UnModifiedCollection. Basically it means JVM is preventing 
	you to perform some operation.
