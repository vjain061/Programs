1. ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList are two weakly consistent/fail safe collection classes.
	In case of fail fast collections whenever we call next() method first it will check the value of of 
	"modCount" which indicate that the collection is changed or not, If the the value of modCount is not 
	as same as before then it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.

2. Queue In Collection :-
    2.1 -> Diff between poll() and remove() method in Queue interface is poll() method return null if queue is empty.
		but remove() method throw java.util.NoSuchElementException exception.
		
3. UnSupportedException comes when you try to add the value in UnModifiedCollection. Basically it means JVM is preventing 
	you to perform some operation.
	
4. Default size of Queue is 11.

5. Default size of HashMap bucket is 16.

6. ConcurrentHashMap provides better performance by locking only the portion of the map rather than blocking the whole
	map resulting in greater shared access, it does not allow null key or null value.
	
	a. ReentrantLock lock for locking macanism.
	b. default capacity = 16
	c. loadfactor = 0.75
	d. cuncurrency level = 16
	e. it is better choice more reads then write.
