1. Full Binary Tree -> Each node has exactly zero or two children.

2. Compelete Binary Tree -> A binary tree, which is completely filled with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is
    filled from left to right.
    
3. When to use AVL tree and when to use Red-Black tree?
    Ans :- If searching is frequent then we should you AVL tree,
           and if Modification is frequest then we should you Red-Black tree.
           
4. Design Data structure which give 0(1) time complexity in all CURD opearation.       
    Ans :- For this requirement what we will do is we will create a array of same size as original array.
    and while inserting or deleting value we will insert true or false in another array. And value of the 
    array can be get by index only so before checking the value in original array we first see the value
    of another array is true or false. If it is false then value has been deleted and if it is returning
    true it means value is present in the array. By this technique we can achive the 0(1) complexity.

5. How find that is there cycle in LinkedList?

6. Find the middle of a given linked list?
    Method 1:
        Traverse the whole linked list and count the no. of nodes. Now traverse the list again till count/2 and return the node at count/2.
    Method 2:
        Traverse linked list using two pointers. Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two. When the fast pointer reaches end slow 
        pointer will reach middle of the linked list.
