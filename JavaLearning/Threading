0. Volatile VS Atomic
  Ans :- Volatile only ensures that the access is atomically, while Atomics ensure that the operation is atomically. 

1. What is deamon thread ?
  Ans :- It is a thread which runs in background, to create any thread as deamon thread just call setDeamon(true) method and to 
    check if this is deamon thread or not then call inDeamon() method.
    
2. Why thread communication methods wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are in Object class?
  Ans :- In the Java language, you wait() on a particular instance of an Object – a monitor assigned to that object to be precise. 
    If you want to send a signal to one thread that is waiting on that specific object instance then you call notify() on that object.
    If you want to send a signal to all threads that are waiting on that object instance, you use notifyAll() on that object.

    If wait() and notify() were on the Thread instead then each thread would have to know the status of every other thread. 
    How would thread1 know that thread2 was waiting for access to a particular resource? If thread1 needed to call thread2.notify() 
    it would have to somehow find out that thread2 was waiting. There would need to be some mechanism for threads to register 
    the resources or actions that they need so others could signal them when stuff was ready or available.

3. Why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods have to be called from synchronized method or block?
  Ans :- When a Thread calls wait() on any Object, it must have the monitor on the Object that it will leave and goes in wait state until 
    any other thread call notify() on this Object. Similarly when a thread calls notify() on any Object, it leaves the monitor on the
    Object and other waiting threads can get the monitor on the Object. Since all these methods require Thread to have the Object
    monitor, that can be achieved only by synchronization, they need to be called from synchronized method or block.

4. Why Thread sleep() and yield() methods are static?
  Ans :- Thread sleep() and yield() methods work on the currently executing thread. So there is no point in invoking these methods on 
    some other threads that are in wait state. That’s why these methods are made static so that when this method is called statically,
    it works on the current executing thread and avoid confusion to the programmers who might think that they can invoke these 
    methods on some non-running threads.
    
5. Join method best example.....


public class JoinMethodWorkingInThread {

	public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException {
		
		//Planning Start
		Planning planning = new Planning();
		Thread planningThread = new Thread(planning);
		planningThread.start();
		//Planning End
		
		//Development Start
		Development development = new Development();
		Thread developmentThread = new Thread(development);
		planningThread.join();
		developmentThread.start();
		//Development End
		
		//Testing Start
		Testing testing = new Testing();
		Thread testingThread = new Thread(testing);
		developmentThread.join();
		testingThread.start();
		//Testing End
	}

}

class Planning implements Runnable {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Planning...");
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println("Planning Completed");
	}
	
}

class Development implements Runnable {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Development...");
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println("Development Completed");
	}
	
}

class Testing implements Runnable {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Testing...");
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println("Testing Completed");
	}
	
}

6. Diff between callable and runnable?

Runnable                                Callable
1. Run(), Start()                       1. Call(), Submit()
2. Can't return value                   2. Returns future object
3. Can't throw checked exception        3. Can throw checked exception
4. Java 1.0                             4. Java 1.5

7. Semaphore vs Mutex
Mutex is a object owned by thread, so there is a ownership in mutex. Mutex allow only one thread to access resources.
Semaphore is singnaling mechanism. It allows a number of thread to access shared resources.

8. CyclicBarrier VS CountDownLatch
If you look at CyclicBarrier it also does the same thing but it is different you can not reuse CountDownLatch once the count reaches zero while 
you can reuse CyclicBarrier by calling the reset() method which resets Barrier to its initial State.

 * <p>A {@code CountDownLatch} is initialized with a given <em>count</em>.
 * The {@link #await await} methods block until the current count reaches
 * zero due to invocations of the {@link #countDown} method, after which
 * all waiting threads are released and any subsequent invocations of
 * {@link #await await} return immediately.  This is a one-shot phenomenon
 * -- the count cannot be reset.  If you need a version that resets the
 * count, consider using a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
