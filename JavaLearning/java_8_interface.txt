java 8 interface can have Default and Static methods.

1. Default Method -> 

a. This allow us to add new method in interface that are automatically available in implementation.
b. Implicitly public that means no need to write public keyword.
c. By using default method we can have backward compatibility neatly preserved.
d. To incrementally provide additional functionality to given type without breaking down the implementation classes.

Note -> If more that one interfaces are having same default method then it is mandatory to override that method in implemented classes other wise you will
get compile time error.

2. Static Method -> 

a. Static interface method increse the degree of cohesion (cohesion is a relation between elements inside a module)
b. If we are defining static method in our interface then we don't need to create util classes.


Abstract class vs java8 interface
1. Abstract class can have constructor, state and behaviour.
