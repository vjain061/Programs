1. If you are extending Parent in Child class then first static block of parent will get executed and then child's class static block will get executed.
2. After executing static block of both the classes main method of parent will get executed.
3. If you are creating object of parent class in main method then below is the flow :-
    a. Static block of super
    b. Static block of child
    c. Main method has been called
    d. Constructor of super
    e. Constructor of child
4. Non-static variable x cannot be referenced from a static context.
5. We can not declare the static variable inside the block. If we declare static variable inside the block, then we will get the compile time error : illegal start of expression.


Important point to tell is ki jo non-static block hota he vo pura uthke constructor me aa jata he while running the program but constructor me sbse upar super() call rehta
he isliye parent ke non-static or constructor call ho jate he..........ye bilkul confirm he.
