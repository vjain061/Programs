1. Why to use kotlin?

Ans :-
a. Concise [Drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code].
b. Safe [Avoid entire classes of errors such as null pointer exceptions] [Kotlin protects you from mistakenly operating on nullable types       if try to access any value of object which can be null then the program won't compile].
c. Introperable [Leverage existing libraries for the JVM, Android, and the browser][ Use any existing library on the JVM, as thereâ€™s 100%       compatibility, including SAM support].
d. Tool-friendly [Choose any Java IDE or build from the command line]
